Instructions on how to use our assembler/disassembler:

1) Open the jar file, and choose what type of conversion you want to execute.

2) Upon choosing between assembler or disassembler, prompt about user input for the filename will appear. You may specify the path of the file, or only the filrname if it happened to be in the same folder as the jar file. Be sure to add the file extension.

3) Hit enter and the prompt will display saying the conversion had been successful.

4) To check, the converted file is stored in the same directory.

Note: the format of the name of the converted c file is the same name as the original file of the assembly used. The format of the name of the converted assembly has an appended prefix of converted plus the name of the c file used.

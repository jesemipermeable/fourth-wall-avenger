Instructions on how to use our assembler/disassembler:
Note: make sure to have two folders, Asmconverted and Cconverted. These are going to be the destination folders of the converted files.

1) Open the jar file, and choose what type of conversion you want to execute.

2) Upon choosing between assembler or disassembler, prompt about user input for the filename will appear. You have to specify the path of the file as the jar file. Be sure to add the file extension.

3) Hit enter and the prompt will display saying the conversion had been successful.

4) To check, the converted file is stored in the directory above (Asmconverted or Cconverted).

Note: The format of the name of the converted file has an appended prefix of 'converted' plus the name of the file used.
